            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Introduction to Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. At Leafloom, we use cookies to enhance your browsing experience and to help us improve our website.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Essential Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Performance Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Functional Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Targeting Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. First-Party Cookies</h3>
            <p>First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting. Only that website can read them. In addition, a website might use a separate company to analyze how people are using their site, and that company would set their own cookie to do this.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
            <p>Third-party cookies are set by someone other than the owner of the website you're visiting. Some web pages may feature content from third-party sites, like YouTube or Facebook, and these sites may set their own cookies.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Session Cookies</h3>
            <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. These cookies are essential for certain applications or functionality to work correctly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. Persistent Cookies</h3>
            <p>Persistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). These cookies are used to store your preferences so that they're available for the next visit.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">9. Secure Cookies</h3>
            <p>Secure cookies can only be transmitted over encrypted connections (i.e. HTTPS). They cannot be transmitted over unencrypted connections (i.e. HTTP). This makes the cookie less likely to be intercepted by malicious third parties.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. HttpOnly Cookies</h3>
            <p>HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by client-side APIs, such as JavaScript. This restriction eliminates the threat of cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS). However, the cookie remains vulnerable to cross-site tracing (XST) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">11. SameSite Cookies</h3>
            <p>The SameSite attribute helps prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by restricting how cookies are sent with cross-site requests. It can be set to 'Strict', 'Lax', or 'None'.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">12. Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p>We use analytics cookies to collect information about how visitors use our website. This helps us understand user behavior and improve our services. The data collected is aggregated and anonymous, ensuring your privacy is maintained.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">13. Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>Advertising cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">14. Social Media Cookies</h3>
            <p>These cookies are set by social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They can track your browser across other sites and build up a profile of your interests.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">15. Cookie Consent Management</h3>
            <p>We provide you with the option to manage your cookie preferences. You can choose to accept or decline cookies when you first visit our site. You can also change your preferences at any time through your browser settings.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">16. How to Delete Cookies</h3>
            <p>You can delete cookies that are already on your computer by going to your browser settings. Each browser has its own method for managing cookies, so please refer to your browser's help section for specific instructions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">17. How to Block Cookies</h3>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">18. Cookie Policy Updates</h3>
            <p>We may update our cookie policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for the latest information on our cookie practices.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">19. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about our cookie policy or our use of cookies, please contact us at the details provided below. We are happy to assist you with any inquiries you may have.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">20. Cookie Duration</h3>
            <p>The duration of cookies can vary. Some cookies are session cookies that expire when you close your browser, while others are persistent cookies that remain on your device for a specified period or until you delete them.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">21. Third-Party Cookie Policies</h3>
            <p>We encourage you to review the cookie policies of any third-party services we use, as we do not control how they use cookies. Each third-party service may have its own cookie policy that you should review.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">22. Cookie Settings in Browsers</h3>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">23. Cookie Consent Banner</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, you will see a cookie consent banner that informs you about our use of cookies. You can accept or decline cookies through this banner, and your preferences will be saved for future visits.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">24. Cookie Management Tools</h3>
            <p>There are various tools available that can help you manage cookies on your device. These tools can provide you with more control over your cookie preferences and help you maintain your privacy online.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">25. Cookie Compliance</h3>
            <p>We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding cookies and privacy. Our cookie policy is designed to ensure transparency and provide you with the information you need to make informed choices.</p>
